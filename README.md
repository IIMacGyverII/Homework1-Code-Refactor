This was a homework project focused on optimizing the html and css of an exsisting website but keeping the apearance exactly as it was when it was unoptimized.

To do this required the following:
 1. Changing all divs to sections
 2. Moving the "header" to the "head" of the html
 3. Changing multiple classes to IDs and viseaversa
 4. Consolidating muliple redunant classes and IDs in to single classes and IDs
 5. Moved footer out of body

Personally this project took a large amount of trial and error and a lot of failures.  That is the best way I learn in an extensive hands on fashion.
